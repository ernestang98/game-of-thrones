## Game of Thrones

Game of Thrones is a MMORPG-based learning platform built using Unity3D. Students can login with their University's email account and enter a 3D world where they can explore and go on quests. Within each quest, students are to complete subquests while answering questions based on their coursework (e.g. Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence). For each question students answer correctly, they will earn points which will go into a ranking system and a leaderboard to facilitate friendly competition with peers. Platform will spawn "enemies" for students to fight with. Students with higher points and ranks unlock more avatars and cosmetics. Students can be assigned ad-hoc mini-quests to earn additional points and rank up in the leaderboard! 

Questions quizzed on the platform are added by teachers on a separate full-stacked interface (React, Python, FastAPI, SQLite), additionally allowing teachers to create and share mini-quests on social media to inform students of newly created mini-quests for them to attempt. Teachers can generate statistics and summary reports of individual students or the entire cohort. Both of the interfaces are unit tested (Unity Test Framework, Jest, Enzyme, PyTest) and load tested (Performance Testing Extension for Unity, Cicada Distributed) to ensure that our interfaces will function correctly and perform under high traffic. Administration interface is also additionally security tested using Selenium and OWASP ZAP since this interface accesses sensitive data.

- Game repository is incomplete as I am unable to push the full source code to github due to file size restrictions (entire project size ~10GB).
